# SmapCr
## What is this?
A small initial map editor project for my game and future **game engine**. Supports both orthogonal and isometric editing of isometric maps.
The following libraries were used:
> [raylib&raymath](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib)
> [raygui](https://github.com/raysan5/raygui)
> [nfd](https://github.com/btzy/nativefiledialog-extended)
> [zvec](https://github.com/Zuhaitz-dev/zvec.h)(if he ll add C++ support)

## What's next?
- more functionality
- add callback functions as object parameters (for **game engine**)
- Implementation of a game engine to make games with minimal code
